# What is IB2F?
IB2F (or Intense Battle 2 Flash) is a JavaScript Flash alternative. 
Just like Adobe Flash, you are able to create applications and games. 
Unlike Adobe Flash, you are limited to browser technologies. 
However, users do not need to install a plugin to use it.

# Is IB2F fast/safe?
IB2F is designed to be fast, easy to use, and (for the most part) safe. 
Just like anythiny programmed in JavaScript, there are always security errors. 
By default, IB2F comes with no extra protection. However, plugins may provide extra security options such as encryption, malware checking, and similar features.

# What do I need to use IB2F?
IB2F works in anything that processes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. By default, IB2F uses HTML5 for flash features, but plugins may be used to support older versions of HTML.

# What are IB2F plugins and what can they do?
IB2F plugins are pieces of javascript code that add extra functionality to IB2F. 
Plugins may allow IB2F to use different protocols, take different inputs or handle inputs differently, or increase compatibility with another technology or device.
For example, a flash game might use an engine to support console controllers or add touch controls to people playing on mobile, or a bank application might use a plugin to encrypt data being sent to their servers and back.
